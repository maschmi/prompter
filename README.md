 This intends to be a simple tui/cli to parse a given directory for mp3 and txt files. Then use mpg123 to play the audio file
 and display the paired text file on the screen. When there is no text file it just plays the audio file and the other
 way around. 
 
 My first project in rust. Let see where it takes me :) Hopefully to writing tests....
